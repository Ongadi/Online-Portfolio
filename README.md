# Online-Portfolio

### A brief description of my project.

Welcome to my portfolio project!

The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and functional online portfolio to showcase my work and skills. I utilized Bootstrap to create a responsive layout that looks great on a variety of devices.

I also utilized JavaScript to add dynamic elements such as a slideshow on the homepage and smooth scrolling between sections.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and learning more about my skills and experience. Thank you for visiting!
